config PSTORE
	bool "Persistent store support"
	default n
	help
	   This option enables generic access to platform level
	   persistent storage via "pstore" filesystem that can
	   be mounted as /dev/pstore.  Only useful if you have
	   a platform level driver that registers with pstore to
	   provide the data, so you probably should just go say "Y"
	   (or "M") to a platform specific persistent store driver
	   (e.g. ACPI_APEI on X86) which will select this for you.
	   If you don't have a platform persistent store driver,
	   say N.

config PSTORE_RAM
	tristate "Log panic/oops to a RAM buffer"
	depends on PSTORE
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_ENC8
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC8
	help
	  This enables panic and oops messages to be logged to a circular
	  buffer in RAM where it can be read back at some later point.

	  Note that for historical reasons, the module will be named
	  "ramoops.ko".

	  For more information, see Documentation/ramoops.txt.

config PSTORE_DUMP_TASKS
	bool "Dump task information"
	default n
	depends on PSTORE
	help
	  This option allows a dump of task information during a
	  panic.  This is equivalent to a magic sysrq 't' command
	  but the result is captured from the console and written
	  to persistent storage.  Note that this happens after
	  pstore dumps kernel messages because the task dump will
	  overwrite other kernel messages.
